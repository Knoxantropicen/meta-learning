# Model-Based Meta-Reinforcement Learning
A PyTorch implementation of paper [Learning to Adapt in Dynamic, Real-World Environments through Meta-Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11347.pdf).

## Todo List
- Add code for test time
- Create custom tasks
- Parameter tuning
- More parallelization
